// MAL - main
//******************************************************************************

// Swift requires that main() be invoked from a file named "main.swift". See the
// paragraph "Application Entry Points and “main.swift” on
// https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=7:
//
//      You’ll notice that earlier we said top-level code isn’t allowed in most
//      of your app’s source files. The exception is a special file named
//      “main.swift”, which behaves much like a playground file, but is built
//      with your app’s source code. The “main.swift” file can contain top-level
//      code, and the order-dependent rules apply as well. In effect, the first
//      line of code to run in “main.swift” is implicitly defined as the main
//      entrypoint for the program.  This allows the minimal Swift program to be
//      a single line — as long as that line is in “main.swift”.
