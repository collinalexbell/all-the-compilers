x-GraalVM-Message-PostInst: NOTES:\n---------------\nSome R packages nee
 d a system-dependent configuration before they can be installed. A gener
 ic configuration that works out of the box in most cases is provided by 
 default. If you wish to fine-tune the configuration to your system or sh
 ould you encounter any issues during R package installation, try running
  the following script that adjusts the configuration to your system: \n 
    ${graalvm_home}/jre/languages/R/bin/configure_fastr\n\nThe R componen
 t comes without native image by default. If you wish to build the native
  image, which provides faster startup, but slightly slower peak performa
 nce, then run the following:\n   ${graalvm_home}/jre/languages/R/bin/ins
 tall_r_native_image\n\nThe native image is then used by default. Pass '-
 -jvm' flag to the R or Rscript launcher to use JVM instead of the native
  image. Note that the native image is not stable yet and is intended for
  evaluation purposes and experiments. Some features may not work when th
 e native image is installed, most notably the --polyglot switch. The nat
 ive image can be uninstalled using the installation script with 'uninsta
 ll' argument.\n\nSee http://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/langua
