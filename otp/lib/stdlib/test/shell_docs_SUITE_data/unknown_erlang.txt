  By convention, most Built-In Functions (BIFs) are included in this
  module. Some of the BIFs are viewed more or less as part of the
  Erlang programming language and are auto-imported. Thus, it is
  not necessary to specify the module name. For example, the calls [;;4m[0m
  [;;4matom_to_list(erlang)[0m and [;;4merlang:atom_to_list(erlang)[0m are
  identical.

  Auto-imported BIFs are listed without module prefix. BIFs listed
  with module prefix are not auto-imported.

  BIFs can fail for various reasons. All BIFs fail with reason [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mbadarg[0m if they are called with arguments of an incorrect type.
  The other reasons are described in the description of each
  individual BIF.

  Some BIFs can be used in guard tests and are marked with "Allowed
  in guard tests".
