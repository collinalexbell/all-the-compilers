  [;1m                  when Filename :: filename_all(), Pid :: pid().[0m

  If [;;4mPid[0m is an I/O device, that is, a pid returned from [;;4mopen/2[0m,
  this function returns the filename, or rather:

  [;;4m[;;4m{ok, Filename}[0m[0m:
    If the file server of this node is not a slave, the file was
    opened by the file server of this node (this implies that [;;4mPid[0m
    must be a local pid) and the file is not closed. [;;4mFilename[0m is
    the filename in flat string format.

  [;;4m[;;4mundefined[0m[0m:
    In all other cases.

  Warning:
    This function is intended for debugging only.
