[;;4mSince[0m:
  24.0

  Raises an exception of class [;;4merror[0m with the reason [;;4mReason[0m,
  where [;;4mReason[0m is any term. [;;4mArgs[0m is expected to be the list of
  arguments for the current function; it is used to provide the
  arguments for the current function in the stack back-trace. If the [;;4m[0m
  [;;4m{error_info, ErrorInfoMap}[0m option is given, it will be injected
  into the stacktrace.

  As evaluating this function causes an exception to be raised, it
  has no return value. The intent of the exception class [;;4merror[0m is
  to signal that an unexpected error has happened (for example, a
  function is called with a parameter that has an incorrect type).
  See the guide about errors and error handling for additional
  information.
