  [;1m-spec link(PidOrPort) -> true when PidOrPort :: pid() | port().[0m

  Creates a link between the calling process and another process (or
  port) [;;4mPidOrPort[0m. If the link already exists or a process
  attempts to create a link to itself, nothing is done. Returns [;;4m[0m
  [;;4mtrue[0m if the link is set up.

  If [;;4mPidOrPort[0m does not exist and checking it is cheap, a [;;4mnoproc[0m
  error is raised. Currently, checking is cheap if the [;;4mPidOrPort[0m
  is local and the caller does not trap exits (see [;;4mprocess_flag/2 [0m
  ).

  Apart from any exit signals from the linked process itself, two
  special exit signals may be sent to the calling process:

   â€¢ [;;4mnoproc[0m is sent immediately if [;;4mPidOrPort[0m does not exist at
     the time of linking (if the caller is trapping exits or [;;4m[0m
     [;;4mPidOrPort[0m is remote).

   â€¢ [;;4mnoconnection[0m if [;;4mPidOrPort[0m is remote and a connection
     between the nodes could not be established or was severed.

  See Processes âžœ Links in the Erlang Reference Manual for more
  details.
