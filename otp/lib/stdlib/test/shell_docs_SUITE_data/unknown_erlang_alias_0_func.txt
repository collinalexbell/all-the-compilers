  Create an alias which can be used when sending messages to the
  process that created the alias. When the alias has been
  deactivated, messages sent using the alias will be dropped. An
  alias can be deactivated using [;;4munalias/1[0m. Currently available
  options for [;;4malias/1[0m:

  [;;4m[;;4mexplicit_unalias[0m[0m:
    The alias can only be deactivated via a call to [;;4munalias/1[0m.
    This is also the default behaviour if no options are passed or
    if [;;4malias/0[0m is called.

  [;;4m[;;4mreply[0m[0m:
    The alias will be automatically deactivated when a reply
    message sent via the alias is received. The alias can also
    still be deactivated via a call to [;;4munalias/1[0m.
