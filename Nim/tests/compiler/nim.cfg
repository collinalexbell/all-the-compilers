# note: consider moving tests/compilerapi/ to tests/compiler/ since
# that's more predictable.

# note: without this, tests may succeed locally but fail on CI (it can succeed
# locally even when compiling via `./bin/nim` because `$HOME/.nimble` is being
# used).
--path:"../../" # so we can `import compiler/foo` in this dir
