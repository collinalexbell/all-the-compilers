##[
This module only exists to generate docs for the compiler.

## links
* [main docs](../lib.html)
* [compiler user guide](../nimc.html)
* [Internals of the Nim Compiler](../intern.html)

#[
note: this is named `index` so that navigating to https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/compiler/
will work.

xxx this should also import other modules, not transitively imported by `compiler/nim.nim`,
eg `evalffi`, otherwise these aren't shown. A glob could be used at CT.
