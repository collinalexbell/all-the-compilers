This folder contains samples used during [my WebRebels 2014 talk about microbenchmarks](mrale.ph/talks/webrebels2014).

Samples `concat`, `concat-fixed`, `method-function`, `method-function-hack`, `prototype`, `prototype-tostring` were collected on the recent V8 3.28.27.

Samples `prototype-node` and `prototype-node-getter` were collected on node.js v0.10.29 and patched to allow IRHydra2 to display them.
