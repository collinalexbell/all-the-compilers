This folder contains parts of Draw2d library translated from Java to Dart.

The translation was mostly done by a java2dart tool and resulting source was
cleaned up manually. Cleanup is incomplete and the libarary definetely contains
untested and/or dead code that does not match Dart style guide.

Translated files retain their original license and comments.
