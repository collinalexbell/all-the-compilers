    Could not deduce (C a1 (a, b0))

      bound by the inferred type for ‘g’: C a1 (a, b) => a1 -> a
      at tests/suite/typecheck/compile/tc168.hs:17:1-16
    The type variable ‘b0’ is ambiguous
    When checking that ‘g’ has the inferred type
      g :: forall a b a1. C a1 (a, b) => a1 -> a
    Probable cause: the inferred type is ambiguous
