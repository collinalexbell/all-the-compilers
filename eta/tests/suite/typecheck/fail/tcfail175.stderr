    Couldn't match expected type ‘String -> String -> String’
                with actual type ‘a’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for evalRHS :: Int -> a
          at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail175.hs:10:12
    Relevant bindings include
      evalRHS :: Int -> a
        (bound at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail175.hs:11:1)
    The equation(s) for ‘evalRHS’ have three arguments,
    but its type ‘Int -> a’ has only one
