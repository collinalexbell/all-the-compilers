    Couldn't match expected type ‘a1’ with actual type ‘a’
      because type variable ‘a1’ would escape its scope
    This (rigid, skolem) type variable is bound by
      an expression type signature: a1
      at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail198.hs:6:36-41
    Relevant bindings include
      xs :: [a] (bound at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail198.hs:6:21)
      x :: a (bound at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail198.hs:6:19)
      f3 :: [a] -> [a]
        (bound at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail198.hs:6:6)
    In the expression: x :: a
    In the second argument of ‘(++)’, namely ‘[x :: a]’
