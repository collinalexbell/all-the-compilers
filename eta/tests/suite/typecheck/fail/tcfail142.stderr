    Could not deduce (Bar a0 r)
    from the context (Bar a r)
      bound by the type signature for bar :: Bar a r => r -> ()
      at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail142.hs:18:8-25
    The type variable ‘a0’ is ambiguous
    In the ambiguity check for the type signature for ‘bar’:
      bar :: forall r a. Bar a r => r -> ()
    To defer the ambiguity check to use sites, enable AllowAmbiguousTypes
    In the type signature for ‘bar’: bar :: Bar a r => r -> ()
