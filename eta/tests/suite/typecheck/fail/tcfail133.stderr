tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail133.hs:68:7: error:
    No instance for (Show r0) arising from a use of ‘show’
    The type variable ‘r0’ is ambiguous
    Note: there are several potential instances:
      instance Show a => Show (GHC.Base.NonEmpty a)
        -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance Show GHC.Stack.Types.CallStack -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      instance Show GHC.Stack.Types.SrcLoc -- Defined in ‘GHC.Show’
      ...plus 46 others
    In the expression: show
    In the expression: show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
    In an equation for ‘foo’:
        foo = show $ add (One :@ Zero) (One :@ One)
