tests/suite/typecheck/fail/FD1.hs:16:1: error:
    Couldn't match expected type ‘Int -> Int’ with actual type ‘a’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
          the type signature for plus :: E a (Int -> Int) => Int -> a
          at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/FD1.hs:15:9
    Relevant bindings include
      plus :: Int -> a (bound at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/FD1.hs:16:1)
    The equation(s) for ‘plus’ have two arguments,
    but its type ‘Int -> a’ has only one
