    Couldn't match type ‘res’ with ‘res1’
      ‘res’ is a rigid type variable bound by

      ‘res1’ is a rigid type variable bound by
             a type expected by the context: (b -> m res1) -> m res1
             at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail076.hs:18:64
    Expected type: m res1
      Actual type: m res
    Relevant bindings include
      cont' :: b -> m res1
        (bound at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail076.hs:18:73)
      cont :: a -> m res
        (bound at tests/suite/typecheck/fail/tcfail076.hs:18:37)
    In the expression: cont a
    In the first argument of ‘KContT’, namely ‘(\ cont' -> cont a)’
