# Philosophy

## Overview

The principles we strive to follow in the Eta REPL are:

- Aesthetic
- Intuitive
- Scalable

## Aesthetic

The REPL should look pleasant to the eyes and make you *want* to use it as much as possible.

## Intuitive

The REPL should commands should have memorable names for the function they perform and there should be little friction for day-to-day use. In other words, it shouldn't get in your way!

## Scalable

The REPL should be fast whether you are working on a one module project or a 1,000 module project.
