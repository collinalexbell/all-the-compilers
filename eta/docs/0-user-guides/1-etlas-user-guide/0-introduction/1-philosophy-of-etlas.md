# Philosophy of Etlas

## Overview

The principles we strive to follow in Etlas are:

- Simplicity
- Reproducibility

## Simplicity

No need to memorize so many commands and flags. Just remember `etlas build` and `etlas run`.

## Reproducibility

An `etlas build` that works on you system should work on any other system. Therefore, Etlas manages your Eta installation to ensure that you have the right version of Eta to build a given project.

In the next section, we'll install Etlas.
