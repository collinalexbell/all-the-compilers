# Philosophy

## Overview

The principles we strive to follow in the Eta plugin are:

- Minimality
- Interoperability
- Reproducibility

## Minimality

The user should only have to specify the minimum information needed for the plugin to run the build. There should be smart defaults.

## Interoperability

The plugin should integrate seamlessly into Gradle's infrastructure and take advantage of as many of Gradle's built-in features as possible. Moreover, multi-module Gradle projects involving other JVM languages should **just work**.

## Reproducibility

The plugin should warn the user if they have specified a build that is not cannot be replicated on another system easily. A Gradle build that works on your system should work on other systems without issues.

## Next Section

We will now proceed to learn the basics of Gradle.
