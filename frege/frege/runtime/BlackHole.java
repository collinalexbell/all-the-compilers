 * Black holes are expressions that demand evaluation of themselves
 * while they are evaluated.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>Consider:</p>
 *  
 *  <p><code>let a = a + 1 in a + 42</code></p>
 *  
 *  <p>Note that the following is not a blackhole:</p>
 *  
 *  <p><code> let a = 1:a in take 20 a </code></p>
 *  
 *  <p>because evaluation of <code>1:a</code> does not demand
 *  evaluation of <code>a</code>.</p>
