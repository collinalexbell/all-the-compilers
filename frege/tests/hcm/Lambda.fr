--- Haskell Lambda syntax

module tests.hcm.Lambda where

-- the following is now a syntax error
--      Frege: unexpected operator : while trying to parse lambda patterns
--      Haskell: parse error on input `:'
-- s = \x:xs -> xs 

-- and this is also an error
--      Frege: constructor Maybe.Just demands 1 arguments, but you gave 0
--      Haskell: Constructor `Just' should have 1 argument, but has been given none
-- j = \Just x -> x
