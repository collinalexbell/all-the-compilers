{-- 
    From the Haskell 2010 report:

    An abbreviated form of module, consisting only of the module body, is permitted. 
    If this is used, the header is assumed to be

    > module Main whereâ€™

    If the first lexeme in the abbreviated module is not a @{@, 
    then the layout rule applies for the top level of the module.

main = println (hello ++ " from Main")

hello = "Greetings"
