module tests.nocomp.Issue53 where

    Type checks without errors, but then in code generation the compiler aborts with:

    > F tests/nocomp/Issues53.fr:14:  unknown context: Show <3251 a>
    
    Correct behaviour would be when the type checker would complain 
    > E tests/nocomp/Issue53.fr:17: inferred type is more constrained than expected type
    >    inferred:  Show t3252 => [String] -> IO ()
    >    expected:  [String] -> IO ()

    Note that there is the implicit annotation:

    > main :: [String] -> IO ()
-}

main _ = println []
