# A Micro-Manual for LISP - Not the whole truth

A neatly typeset version of John McCarthy's classic paper "A Micro-Manual for
LISP - Not the whole truth".

The [original](https://cse.sc.edu/~mgv/csce330f15/micromanualLISP.pdf) is a very
poorly scanned image and text cannot be copied or read easily. This aims to be a
verbatim copy of the original, character by character. Any deviation unless
explicitly noted is a bug.
