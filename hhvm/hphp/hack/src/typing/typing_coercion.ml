(*
* These are the main coercion functions. Roughly, coercion should be used over
* subtyping in places where a particular type that could be dynamic is
* required, like parameters and returns.
*
* The old dynamic uses the following ideas:
*
* There are only a few coercion (~>) rules, documented in hphp/hack/doc/type_system/hack_typing.ott.
*
* 1. |- t ~> dynamic
*    (you can coerce t to dynamic)
* 2. t is enforceable |- dynamic ~> t
*    (coercion from dynamic to enforceable types is permitted)
* 3. T1 ~> T and T2 ~> T |- T1|T2 ~> T
*    (coercion from a union is valid if coercion from each element is valid)
* 4. t1 <: t2 |- t1 ~> t2
*    (you can coerce t1 to any of its supertypes)
*
* This boils down to running the normal sub_type procedure whenever possible,
* and catching the remaining cases. The normal sub_type procedure is important
* for resolving/inferring various types (e.g. array's union types), as well as
* useful to the user for error messages. In the cases where we do not want to
* sub_type, it suffices to do nothing.
*
*
* The experimental sound dynamic (--enable-sound-dynamic-type) works
* differently because it is not always safe to coerce a type to dynamic.
* The canonical example of something that it is not safe to coerce to dynamic,
* is a Box<T> with a property T, get, and set functions.
* The following leads to putting a string into a Box<int>
* $b = new Box<int>(1); // $b : Box<int>
* $d = $b;
* $d as dynamic;   // $d : dynamic & Box<int>
* $d->set("a");    // fine to call set on $d since it is dynamic
* $b->get();       // returns "a", but the type is int.
*
* Coercing from dynamic happens when the expected type will be enforced by
* hhvm, in this case, if whatever happens to be in the dynamic isn't of the
* expected type, execution will not continue. Hence,
* t1 ~> t2 if t2 is enforced and t1 <: dynamic, without having to
* coerce t1 to dynamic, e.g., t1 = dynamic or t1 = dynamic | C, but
* not t1 = C and C implements dynamic. The latter restriction ensures that
* static type errors are generated where nothing in the program explicitly
* coerces anything to dynamic.
*
* Coercion to dynamic happens in the sub-typing algorithm where it is allowed
* to conclude that C <: dynamic if C implements dynamic. Again, we don't want
* sub-typing to always be able to deduce this, only when we might be checking
* a sub-typing relationship where the super-type could contain a programmer
* supplied dynamic.

      (* It's critical that we don't allow the sub-type check here to coerce to dynamic.
         If we did, then the following would type check:
         function f(string $s) : void {} ... f(1)
         We would check that int is a sub-type of string | dynamic, and it would
         be if we allow int <: dynamic in the check.

         We could imagine that we need the coercion to dynamic in order for
         ty_have to be a sub-type of ty_expect without the extra union with dynamic.
         This would lead to needing to do two different sub-type checks. However, this
         turns out to be unnecessary because of the restricted form that enforced types
         can have. An enforced type must be an atomic type, mixed, nothing,
         an optional enforced type, or a class type where all generics
         are reified and applied to enforced types.

         Thus the only way for dynamic to appear is if the type is
         C<dynamic, ...>, where C's type parameters are reified.
         Critically, reified parameters are invariant, and so we don't have C<int> <: C<dynamic> even
         with coercion to dynamic enabled.
         The computation of the enforcement takes care that top-level dynamic
         and ?dynamic are not considered Enforced.
