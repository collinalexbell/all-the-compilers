All files in this directory

* pass the Hack type checker (i.e. `hh_single_type_check <filename>` produces `No errors` output);
* fail with a fatal when run under HHVM (type `php <filename>` to demonstrate this).

Each file is named with an associated task number that has the tag `typehole`.

In other words, the expected output of "No errors" is wrong, but it's
useful to keep the tests here as ready-made regression tests for when the
related type hole is fixed.

If any of these tests start "failing" with an error, it's likely that
the type hole has been fixed. Please move the file to the main
typecheck directory or an appropriate subdirectory, and check that the
error makes sense.
