FAQ for FreeBSD
===============

BufferedInputStreamAvailableTest.java fails.
--------------------------------------------

This is due to GNU Classpath's native library. See this bug report
for details.

http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31927

This bug has been fixed, but the fixed files have not been imported
to Kaffe yet.  Install GNU Classpath from the CVS repository, then
install Kaffe with the configuration option "--with-system-classpath".
