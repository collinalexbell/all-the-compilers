* GNU Classpath VM interface

Taken from GNU Classpath, which is licensed under the GNU General Public
License with a special exception:

	Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
	making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
	conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
	combination.

	As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
	permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
	executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
	modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
	terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
	independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
	module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from
	or based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend
	this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
	obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this
	exception statement from your version. 

See the file license.terms for details of the GNU GPL.

* m4/iconv.m4, m4/lib-ld.m4, m4/lib-link.m4, m4/lib-prefix.m4

Autoconf macros for libiconv. Taken from GNU gettext CVS. Licensed under
the GNU General Public License with a special exception:

  " As a special exception to the GNU General
  Public License, this file may be distributed as part of a program
  that contains a configuration script generated by Autoconf, under
  the same distribution terms as the rest of that program."

Autoconf macros to check for accepted warning and compiler options, pthreads, 
compile time values and Java development tools. Taken from the Autoconf Macro 
Archive at http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/.

Licensed under the GNU General Public License with a special exception:

    Every Autoconf macro presented on this web site is free software; you
    can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU 
    General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; 
    either version 2, or (at your option) any later version.

    As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited 
    permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that 
    are the output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU 
    General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even 
    though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU 
    General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material 
    that constitutes the Autoconf program.

    Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied 
    (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of 
    Autoconf. We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf 
    source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides 
    which of the data portions to output in any given case. We call these 
    comments and executable code the "non-data" portions. Autoconf never 
    copies any of the non-data portions into its output.

    This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf 
    released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute 
    a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception 
    to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless* your 
    modified version has the potential to copy into its output some of the 
    text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started 
    with. (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from 
    the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your modification has 
    such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception to 
    the GPL from your modified version.
