A collection of M/o/Vfuscated example programs:

	nibbles:
		Compiled from C to movs with M/o/Vfuscator2.
		Move with w, a, s, d.
		The jmp at the end and external calls still need to be movfuscated.

	factor:
		Compiled from BF to movs with M/o/Vfuscator1.
		Example of using no compiler flags, leaving the int 0x80 and single jmp.

	primes:
		Compiled from BF to movs with M/o/Vfuscator1.
		Example of -nojmp flag, removing the jmp instruction at the end.

	99_bottles:
		Compiled from BASIC to BF with BFBASIC, BF to movs with M/o/Vfuscator1.
		Example of -mmio and -nojmp flags, leaving only mov instructions.
		Uses MMIO for output, so requires file-backed I/O streams.

Run with:

	./example

Executables compiled with the -mmio flag require file-backed I/O streams, and
should be run with:

	./example < sample_in > sample_out

or:

	./demo.sh example

to watch the output directly.
