## OpenLibm

OpenLibm contains code that is covered by various licenses.

The OpenLibm code derives from the FreeBSD msun and OpenBSD libm
implementations, which in turn derives from FDLIBM 5.3. As a result, it
has a number of fixes and updates that have accumulated over the years
in msun, and also optimized assembly versions of many functions. These
improvements are provided under the BSD and ISC licenses. The msun
library also includes work placed under the public domain, which is
noted in the individual files. Further work on making a standalone
OpenLibm library from msun, as part of the Julia project is covered
under the MIT license. The test files, test-double.c and test-float.c
are under the LGPL.
