This directory contains proof of concept code as demoed at the Defcon 24
Conference.

It requires the Witchcraft Compiler Collection to be installed.

This directory contains C code that is compiled with gcc (or clang), then
transformed back to a relocatable object file using wcc, and relinked into
an executable using gcc and gnu ld. When run, the original executable and the 
final one provide the same output.

This has been tested using x86_64 versions of both clang and gcc. Some
relocation handling might be required to get this to work on other
architectures or if compiled with certain compiler flags. Feel free to
contribute your patches back to WCC if you implement new types of relocations
:)
