The code in this directory demonstrates how to link C code against an ELF 
binary compiled as Position Independent Code (PIE).
In this case we link against apache2 and call a function within this binary as
if it was a shared library (which it really is in addition to being an 
executable).

This requires apache to be compiled with -rdynamic compilation flag to expose
the relevant symbols in the dynamic symbol table, as well as the -pie -fPIE
flags to be passed at compile time to enable full ASLR and allow the binary
to be mapped with any base address (both should be default if your binary is 
shipped with a recent Linux distribution). The binary can be stripped.
