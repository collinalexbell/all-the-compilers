This directory contains proof of concept code to transform /usr/sbin/proftpd
(assumed to not be compiled as Position Independant Code - else see the
apache directory in the upper directory instead).

The code is then used as a shared library from demo C code than call
a function within proftpd to return its current version number as a string.

This requires a custom linker script to make sure gcc (or clang) assigns
our code a different base address than the one of our "non relocatable shared
library" proftpd.
